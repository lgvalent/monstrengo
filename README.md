The most important philosophy of this framework is the abstraction of common elements of an information system and the interconnection of these elements into a rigid architecture. This interconnection enables to build a system tha show all business elements together.

This framework uses many other frameworks for support some technologies, like: Hibernate, Spring, JSF, Log4J, PrimeFaces, etc.

With this framework you can manage entities (pojo objects) in a database. All CRUD operations in a object will be automaticaly recorded in a auditor-ship registers.

With this framework you can implement business processes. Each business process may be related with its entities dependency. When a dependency is identified, the framework may run this business process directly from some entity visualization screen. No menus need to be roamed.
